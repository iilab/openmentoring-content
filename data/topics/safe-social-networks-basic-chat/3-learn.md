When you communicate over Facebook without the use of encryption, the company and all other third parties it potentially shares/discloses your data to (ranging from other advertising companies to law enforcement agencies) can have access to the content of your instant messages (IM) and voice calls (VoIP). Not only can this potentially expose your data to breach, but also that of your contacts. 

To enhance the privacy and security of your communications, you can install Jitsi: a client which supports the Off-the-Record (OTR) protocol for IM encryption and ZRTP for VoIP encryption. This not only makes the content of your communications inaccessible to various third parties, such as governments and corporations, but it also makes it inaccessible to the very companies that provide you the service (such as Facebook, if you are using Facebook Chat).
