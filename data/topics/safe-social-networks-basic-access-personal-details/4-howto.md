You can control who can see various elements of your profile. This doesn't happen in the main privacy settings but directly when editing your profile.

For instance going to About > Contact & Basic Info you can see your date of birth:

If you place your mouse cursor over it, you will see an icon which can be a globe (public), a group (friends of friends), a lock (only me) or possibly other images.
