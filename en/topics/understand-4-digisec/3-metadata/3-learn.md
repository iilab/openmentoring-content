title: "What is metadata?"

Metadata is data about data. It is information about a file (such as a word document, a PDF, a picture, music file etc.) that is stored within the file itself.
<br>
This information can include the time and date a file was created, the username of the people who created or edited it, information about the device that created it, and other kinds of information.
<br>
As a result of this, the metadata in a file could tell someone who created a file, on what computer or device, when, and in what location.
<br>
While this information is generated automatically by many devices (like cameras, computers, and phones) it can be edited and manipulated by those who know where to look. This can also be a good thing, as it means you can take control over the metadata you choose to share when you share files.
<br>
Let's take pictures as an example. When you take a picture with your digital camera, what happens?
<br>
If your camera or phone knows where you are, then that information (in the form of GPS coordinates) can be saved in the metadata of the file.
<br>
If your camera knows what time it is, it records the date and time the picture was taken. If your camera or phone has a serial number that may be recorded in metadata as well.
<br>
Digital image file formats such as TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) and JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) created by digital cameras or smartphones, contain metadata in a format called EXIF (Exchangeable image file format) which could include all of the above information and even a thumbnail of the original image.
<br>
Other files such as text documents include metadata too. A text document's metadata, for example, may contain information about how long the document is, who the author is, when the document was written, and a short summary of the document.
<br>
Emails contain metadata as well. The author of the email, the email recipient, subject line, and date are all metadata. The content of the email, that is, what you are actually writing, is not metadata.
<br>
Nonetheless, metadata from email communication can be used to track correspondence between various actors, even if the content of those emails is encrypted and unable to be read.
<br>
In many cases, metadata tells a story just as interesting as the content itself.
