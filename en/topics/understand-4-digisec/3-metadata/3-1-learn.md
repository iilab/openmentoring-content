# About metadata
Metadata is data about data. It is information about a file (such as a word document, a PDF, a picture, music file etc.) that is stored within the file itself.
<br>
In many cases, metadata tells a story just as interesting as the content itself.
<br>
# Metadata information
This information can include the time and date a file was created, the username of the people who created or edited it, information about the device that created it, and other kinds of information.
<br>
# Learning from metadata
As a result of this, the metadata in a file could tell someone who created a file, on what computer or device, when, and in what location.
