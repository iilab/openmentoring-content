title: Choosing a strong password
---
# Use a password manager
A password should be difficult for a computer program to guess, difficult for others to figure out, and should be chosen so as to minimise damage if someone does learn it. We recommend you use a [Password Manager like KeePassX](topics/tool-4-keepassx/0-getting-started/1-1-intro.md) to keep track of your passwords.
<br>
# Make it long:
The longer a password is, the longer it takes to guess it. Use more than ten characters or ideally a long phrase or sentence. Short passwords of any kind, even totally random ones, are not strong enough for use with encryption today.
<br>
# Make it complex:
Strong passwords are long and include a combination of lower and uppercase letters, numbers and special characters; their strength increases with length and complexity.
<br>
# Don't make it personal:
Don't choose a word or phrase based on information such as you name, telephone number, child's name, pet's name, birth date, or anything else that a person could easily learn by doing a little research about you.
<br>
# Keep it secret:
Don't share your password with anybody unless absolutely necessary! If you must share a password with a family member or colleague, you should change it to a temporary password first, share that one, then change it back when they are done using it.
<br>
# Keep it unique:
Don’t use the same password across devices or for multiple accounts. Otherwise anyone who learns that password will be able to access all accounts with the same password
<br>
# Keep it fresh:
It's important to change your passwords regularly, regardless of how strong of a password you have. We recommend you change your password at least once every three months.
<br>
# Make it memorable:
Password patterns can allow you to use very different but related phrases for all of your accounts, basing one off of the other. For example, if you use your mother’s birthday, you could use your dad’s, brother’s, grandmother’s or dog’s for other accounts.
<br>
# Risks of password patterns
Repeating patterns will make your passwords easy to remember, though it can put you at risk if an adversary gains access to multiple passwords and recognizes the patterns.
<br>
# Use a new pattern
Of course, any pattern model becomes ineffective as soon as it is written or suggested anywhere online (so never use the one we just suggested).
