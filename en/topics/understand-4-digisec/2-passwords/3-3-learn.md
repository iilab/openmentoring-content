title: Use a password manager
---
We recommend you use a password manager to keep track of passwords that are long and complex enough to be adequately secure. A secure password database, such as KeypassX, is a helpful tool for managing passwords for multiple accounts.
<br>
Password managers are considered to be the most secure way to use complex and varying passwords and still remember them. KeePassX is an open-source password manager, and once you've set your master password, it creates and saves passwords for you.
<br>
To enhance convenience, you can synchronise your password database - for example, by using a cloud service, so that you can access your passwords on various computers as well as your phone. That way, you'll have round the clock access to strong passwords.
