# Protecting your information
Passwords are often the first and only barrier between your information and anyone who might want to read, use, or destroy it without your mission

# Passwords are important
Passwords are important for both online security and privacy. Bad passwords can easily nullify most of your other efforts.

# How passwords work
In general, when you want to protect something - whether a house or an email account - you lock it up with a key. All keys, physical and electronic, have one thing in common: they open their locks just as effectively in the hands of somebody else.

# Use strong passwords
You can use the most advanced security tools, but if your password is week, or if you allow it to fall into the wrong hands, they will not do you any good.
