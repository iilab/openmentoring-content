title: Keep backups of information
---
# Protect your information
Take measures to ensure that you recover your most important information in the unfortunate event that you lose a computer either through theft, system collapse, or confiscation/destruction by your adversaries.
<br>
# Keep a backup
Your best bet is to keep a backup of your important information. When creating a backup:
<br>
# Identify important information
Identify your important information and organize it in one
place, such as a folder in your computer.
<br>
# Choose appropriate storage medium
- Select a backup storage medium that allows you to replace your backup document with its latest version.
# External hard drives
An external hard disk drive (HDD), which connects to your computer via USB, has become the storage medium of choice for many.
<br>
# Use several external hard drives
External HDDs can offer storage space of up to 6TB. It is, however, recommended that you store your backups on smaller HDDs, from 350MB to 1TB, which you can keep in separate locations.
<br>
# Keep it separate from your computer
Keep your backups in a separate location from your computer. This ensures that you do not lose both the files on your computer and your backup at the same time.
<br>
# Keep in several different locations
Keeping a couple of backups in different locations is good practice, as long as these too are secured.
<br>
# Remotely backup information
You can also store your backups on remote servers via the internet – on what is now known as the cloud. Ensure you choose a secure online storage service.
<br>
# Recommended remote backup services
Consider secure services like [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com) and [SpiderOak](https://spideroak.com/), which are both quite secure and reliable.
