title: Use open source software
---
# Updating software is constantly
For most small organisations, keeping your paid-for software up to date can be a challenge. Sometimes you have to buy new licences, or whole new software suites, which can be a drain on your budget.
<br>
# Open source software is often free
Consider switching to free and open source software (FOSS) such as the office suite LibreOffice, and an open source operating system such as GNU/Linux-based Ubuntu.
<br>
# Secure open source alternatives
Also consider using Mozilla Thunderbird as your email client and Firefox as your internet browser. As well as being free, FOSS software is also relatively more secure, as there are millions of volunteers looking at the source code and any one of them can spot bugs and fix them much quicker than engineers of proprietary software can.
<br>
# Updated regularly
Independent developers are also constantly developing digital security tools to add to FOSS software.

# Recommended free and open source software
