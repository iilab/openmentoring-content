# Turn on
If your device uses Android version 4.0 or newer, you should turn on device encryption. This can be done in *Settings -> Personal -> Security -> Encryption.*

# Set a screen lock password
Before you can utilise device encryption, however, you will be required to set a screen lock password.

**Note:** Before starting the encryption process, ensure the phone is fully charged and plugged into a power source.
