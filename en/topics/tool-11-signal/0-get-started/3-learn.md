title: Signal basics
---
# Messaging app
Signal sends text messages (SMS), messages via the internet (MMS) and internet voice calls (VOIP).
<br>
# Encrypted content
Using Signal will prevent anyone from being able to read the content of your text messages, but will not hide that you are sending messages, nor will it hide that your recipient is receiving messages.
<br>
# Contacts visible
Signal will only hide who the messages are being sent to if they are sent via the internet, but not when being sent by SMS
<br>
# Think about the risks
In some countries, an encryption app such as Signal may attract attention, be illegal or subject to legal constraints.
<br>
