# Private businesses
Social networking sites are owned by private businesses who make their money by collecting data about people and selling that data on, particularly to third party advertisers.
<br>
# Rules of site owners
When you enter a social networking site, you are leaving the freedoms of the internet behind and are entering a network that is governed and ruled by the owners of the site.
<br>
# Privacy settings
Privacy settings are only meant to protect you from other members of the social network, but they do not shield your data from the owners of the service. This means that you are giving all your data over to the owners and trusting them with it.
