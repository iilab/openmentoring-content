title: Publicising a march...

Brenda and Isaac are going to a march and want to use Facebook to publicise the event. They are worried that the authorities could be tipped off and that anyone who shows an interest could be traced.

They plan to share photos and videos of the march without revealing people's identities, because they worry that participants could face persecution.
