title: The risk matrix: probability and impact
---

It may be that you find there are a lot of threats to your work, and it can be difficult to get some perspective on where to begin.
<br>
In these cases it can be useful to think of the different threats in terms of the probability of their occurrence, and their impact should they occur.
<br>
| Probability |     |          |                           |              |
|-------------|-----|----------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Very high   |     |          | Confiscation of materials |              |
| High        |     | Burglary |                           |              |
| Medium      |     |          | Entrapment and Assault    | Imprisonment |
| Low         |     |          |                           |              |
| Impact      | Low | Medium   | High                      | Catastrophic |

Once you have prioritised the risks to yourself and your work, you can then start to take action to reduce them through building the relavent capacities and integrating them into a security plan.
