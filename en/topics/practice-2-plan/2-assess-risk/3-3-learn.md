title: Actor mapping

In order to understand the risks we face and be able to effectively react, first we should know where they come from; that is to say, **who** is behind them, and **why**.
<br>
We might consider dividing them into three categories: resisting forces, supporting forces, and unknown forces.
<br>
# 1. Resisting forces:

Resisting forces are those who try to prevent us from successfully carrying out our work.

In some cases it may be forces working for or on behalf of the State, who often threaten, stigmatise, arrest, detain, mistreat and prosecute journalists. Getting a sense of who these actors are will help us to understand the nature of the threats to ourselves, our community and our information.
<br>
In other cases, it may be social forces who try to prevent us from promoting and defending human rights. This may include religious institutions or groups, political movements, armed groups, or even family members. Different actors pose different threats to our security, and indeed our digital security.
<br>
The State might have the capacities to listen to our mobile calls, or place viruses on our computers to monitor our online activities. Non-State actors or even common criminals could gather a huge amount of information about us by just monitoring our Facebook page, if everything is open and public.
<br>
Thinking about what we are up against can help us take the right measures to keep them guessing and keep working.
<br>

# 2. Supporting forces
Supporting forces are our friends and allies, who try to support our project in one way or another.
<br>
As part of this 'actor mapping' exercise, you should also consider the actors who are on your side, whether local, regional or international: these could include friends, community members, police, other organisations, embassies and so on.
<br>
It will be important for you to spread your [digital security practices](topics/understand-4-digisec/0-getting-started/1-intro.md) among your allies.
<br>

# 3. Unknown forces
Unknown forces are other actors whose exact intentions, with regard to our security and the success of our work, are unknown or ambiguous.
<br>
An example may be your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or companies such as Facebook or Google, on whom we depend for a lot of our online activities and who may collect and store a lot of information about us.
<br>
An ISP, social network or e-mail provider could be legally pressured by a government to hand over information such as your browsing history, chat logs or emails.
<br>
Due to the large amount of information they collect about your activities, they may also be targets for malicious hackers who want to access that information about you.
