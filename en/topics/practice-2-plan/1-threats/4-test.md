If you want to keep your house and possessions safe, here are a few questions you might ask:

-Should I lock my door?
-What kind of lock or locks should I invest in?
-Do I need a more advanced security system?
-What are the assets in this scenario?
  -The privacy of my home
  -The items inside my home
-What is the threat?
  -Someone could break in.
  -What is the actual risk of someone breaking in? Is it likely?

Once you have asked yourself these questions, you are in a position to assess what measures to take. If your possessions are valuable, but the risk of a break-in is low, then you probably won’t want to invest too much money in a lock. On the other hand, if the risk is high, you’ll want to get the best locks on the market, and perhaps even add a security system.
