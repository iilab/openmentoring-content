title: Making an emergency plan
---
When making an emergency plan, you should specify the frequency and exact means by which you will check in with editors and family members.
<br>
Your plan may also include a simple code to discreetly signal an immediate threat.
<br>
Codes could also be devised to signal that the journalist wants to meet at a prearranged location, or to switch to another means of communication.
<br>
In the event you or a colleague of yours becomes out of touch, the plan should specify how long editors and family members should wait before taking action.
<br>
Your emergency plan should include a detailed list of individuals and groups for editors and loved ones to contact or call locally, regionally and internationally.
