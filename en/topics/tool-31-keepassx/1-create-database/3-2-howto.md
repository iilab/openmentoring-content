title: Save a new KeePassX database
---
# Step 1. Save your KeePassX database
In the KeePassX menu, select File > Save Database As.
<br>
# Step 2. Choose a name for your database
Type in a name for your KeePassX database and {click} Save. You can store it on a USB flash memory stick or locally on your device.
<br>
If you are worried that someone with access to your computer might see this file and demand that you tell them your master passphrase, you should probably come up with a less conspicuous name.
<br>
# Step 3. Confirm you remember your password
Find and re-open your database using your [master passphrase](topics/tool-4-keepassx/1-create-database/3-1-howto.md) before you start adding new password entries to it.
<br>
# Step 4. Closing your database.
There are three ways to close your database:
<br>
1. You can click the {red button} in the top left corner of the database to close it.
<br>
2. In the KeePassX menu, you can select File, then Close Database.
<br>
3. You can use the Close Database shortcut key combination: Command-W. (The Command keys have this symbol: ().
<br>
# Step 4. Re-open KeePassX database
Find your database in the folder where you saved your password. Open it up by either double-clicking the file, or by selecting the file and using the shortcut key combination Command-O.
<br>
# Finding your database
Tip: If your Finder Preferences (Finder Preferences > Advanced) are set to ‘Show all filename extensions’, your database will have a ‘.kdb’ filename extension. In this example, it will show up in your Documents file as passwords.kdb.
<br>
# Remember your password
Tip: If you were unable to open your database because you forgot the master password, there is no way to open your data base, and there is no way to reset or retrieve your master password. If you are unable to remember it, you can create a new database and delete the first one.
