# Your phone can reveal your identity
Be aware that your smart phone is generally tied to your identity. This happens through billing, account services or SIM card registration. Your phone can also reveal your location.

# Encryption does not hide your identity
Encrypted messaging tools do not protect you from sharing this, but they do help protect the content of your communication.
