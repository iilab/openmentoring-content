title: Conducting a threat assessment
---
There five steps to conducting a threat assessment:

> Step 1.
# What do you want to protect?

An asset is something you value and want to protect. When we are talking about digital security, the assets in question are usually information.
<br>
For example, your emails, contact lists, instant messages, and files are all assets. Your devices are also assets.
<br>
Write down a list of data that you keep, where it’s kept, who has access to it, and what stops others from accessing it.
<br>

> Step 2.
# Who do you want to protect it from?

It’s important to understand who might want to target you or your information, or who is your adversary. An adversary is any person or entity that poses a threat against an asset or assets.
<br>
Examples of potential adversaries are your boss, your government, or a hacker on a public network.
<br>
Make a list of who might want to get ahold of your data or communications. It might be an individual, a government agency, or a corporation.
<br>

> Step 3
# How likely is it that you will need to protect it?

A final thing to consider is risk. Risk is the likelihood that a particular threat against a particular asset will actually occur, and goes hand-in-hand with capability.
<br>
While your mobile phone provider has the capability to access all of your data, the risk of them posting your private data online to harm your reputation is low.
<br>
It is important to distinguish between threats and risks. While a threat is a bad thing that can happen, risk is the likelihood that the threat will occur.
<br>
For instance, there is a threat that your building might collapse, but the risk of this happening is far greater in San Francisco (where earthquakes are common) than in Stockholm (where they are not).
<br>
[Conducting a risk analysis](en/topics/practice-2-planning/2-assess-risk/1-1-intro.md) is both a personal and a subjective process; not everyone has the same priorities or views threats in the same way.
<br>
Many people find certain threats unacceptable no matter what the risk, because the mere presence of the threat at any likelihood is not worth the cost.
<br>
In other cases, people disregard high risks because they don't view the threat as a problem.
<br>
In a military context, for example, it might be preferable for an asset to be destroyed than for it to fall into enemy hands. Conversely, in many civilian contexts, it's more important for an asset such as email service to be available than confidential.


> Step 4
# How bad are the consequences if you fail?

The motives of adversaries differ widely, as do their attacks.
<br>
A government trying to prevent the spread of a video showing police violence may be content to simply delete or reduce the availability of that video. Whereas a political opponent may wish to gain access to secret content and publish it without you knowing.
<br>
Write down what your adversary might want to do with your private data.
<br>
The capability of your attacker is also an important thing to think about. For example, your mobile phone provider has access to all of your phone records and therefore has the capability to use that data against you.
<br>
A hacker on an open Wi-Fi network can access your unencrypted communications. Your government might have stronger capabilities.

> Step 5
# How much trouble are you willing to go through in order to try to prevent those?

Based on the results of your risk analysis, you will be able to better determine how much trouble you will need to go through in order to prevent a threat from causing damage.
<br>
Make sure to include responses to threats in your [emergency plan.](en/topics/practice-2-planning/4-emergency-plan/1-1-intro.md)
