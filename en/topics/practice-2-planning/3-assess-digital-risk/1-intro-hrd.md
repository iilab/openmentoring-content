In this section, you learn how to understand the nature of the risk we face with digital data (risk assesment), so that we can make the right decisions about how best to stay safe.

Perhaps without realising, we take decisions based on risk analyses every day: you may chose to lock your office doors when you leave in the evening, to deter thieves.

The idea of this section is to consider that same logic, as it applies to our digital activities, both as human rights defenders and as private people.
