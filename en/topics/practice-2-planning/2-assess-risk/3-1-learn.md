title: Understand risk
---
Risk refers to possible events, however uncertain, that result in harm. Understanding risks can know the right measures to take in order to be more secure.
<br>
Perhaps without realising, we take decisions based on risk analyses every day. You may choose not to walk home through a particular neighbourhood you consider dangerous, or to lock your office doors when you leave in the evening, to deter thieves.
<br>
The idea of this lesson is to learn to understand risk as it applies to our activities as journalists and as private people.
