# Delivery notification
A icon in your message indicates that it has been delivered.
<br>
**Note:** this only appears by default when messages are sent via Internet; to see them when sending SMS you need to enable SMS delivery report in settings.
<br>
**Note:** The messages you receive from your contact will always be grey. If they have a icon, they were received encrypted. If there is no icon **the message was received insecurely.**
