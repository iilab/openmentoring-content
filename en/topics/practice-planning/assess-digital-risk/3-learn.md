In order to understand the risks we face and be able to effectively react, first we should know where they come from; that is to say, > **who** is behind them, and > **why**.

In order to 'map' the actors relevant to our work and our well-being, we might consider dividing them into three categories:

- Resisting forces: These are actors who try to prevent us from successfully carrying out our work.
- Supporting forces: These are our friends and allies, who try to support our project in one way or another.
- Supporting forces: These are our friends and allies, who try to support our project in one way or another.
- Unknown forces: These are other actors whose exact intentions, with regard to our security and the success of our work, are unknown or ambiguous.
