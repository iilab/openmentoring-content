# Understanding the attack
Finding out what has happened to you and who has targeted you may be more important than 'cleaning' your computer. It can be very valuable to gain an understanding of your adversary through letting the attack play out.

# Collect information
If understanding the attacker and the attack is important to you, you must collect and analyse information when a potential malware infection happens. Do this before ‘cleaning’ your computer.

# A risky investment
Keep in mind that counter-surveillance is a big investment, is not easy, and might be perceived by an adversary as an escalation. Weigh the risks and benefits carefully and develop a strategy to decide on next steps by reading the [Risk Analysis](topics/practice-2-planning/2-assess-risk/1-1-intro.md) lesson.

# Communicate safely
Do not reveal that you feel you are being surveilled using electronic commmunications or physical behaviour and read the [Secure Communications](topics/understand-4-digisec/4-secure-communications/1-1-intro.md) lesson to learn how to do so.

# Overt counter-surveillance
Overt counter-surveillance means trying to stop or identity your potential adversary through making them aware of what you are trying to do. This is extremely risky and should not be taken lightly.
