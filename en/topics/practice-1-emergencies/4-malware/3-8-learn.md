If you chose to clean your device without letting the attack play out, please keep the following in mind:
<br>
There is no quick fix to clean up malware from you computer. [Anti-virus software](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/4-malware/3-9-learn.md) may be good at protecting your device from most malware, but it is generally considered ineffective against targeted attacks, especially by state-sponsored actors.
<br>
If you believe you are being targeted by the state, disconnect your device from the internet, turn it off, unplug it, remove the battery from your device and seek the help of a trusted security professional. Refer to your [Emergency Plans](en/topics/practice-2-planning/4-emergency-plan/1-1-intro.md).
