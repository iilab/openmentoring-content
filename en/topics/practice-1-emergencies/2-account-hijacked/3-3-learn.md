If you no longer have access to the account, different providers have different recovery procedures or ways to rest passwords.
<br>
Some providers will send a link to change your password to your recovery email address, while other platforms reset it to your last password.
<br>
In the reset case, it is important to change the password immediately after regaining access to your account.
<br>
If these steps do not work and your account is being abused, contact the platform provider directly. Alternatively, contact the following organisations for possible support in shutting the account down.
