# Review account history
For some platforms (e.g. Facebook, Gmail), it is possible to review connection history and account activity. This will let you know if your account has been accessed by someone else.

# Unfamiliar location
Check to see if your account was accessed at a time when you were not online or if your account was accessed from an unfamiliar location or IP address.

# Are you using Tor?
Be mindful that if you are using the Tor browser or a VPN service, it is possible that the location or IP address may differ from the location you have accessed the platform.
