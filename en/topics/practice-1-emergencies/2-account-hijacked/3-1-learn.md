# Use a different computer
Move to a different computer that you believe to be safe or uncompromised. If you continue using an unsafe computer, you risk putting yourself and others at harm.

# Change your password
Log into your account from the new computer and change the password on your account. Changing your password is the fastest way to regain control of your account.
