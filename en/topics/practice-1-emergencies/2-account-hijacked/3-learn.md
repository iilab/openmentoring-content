Should you suspect your account has been hijacked, the first step you should take is mitigating the problem.
<br>
If you still have access to the account, move to a different computer that you believe to be safe or uncompromised and take the following 5 Steps:


If you do not have access to the account, instuctions will be provided after the following 
<br>
Step 1. Log in to your account from the new computer and change the password on your account.
<br>
Once you have changed your password, take the following 4 steps.
<br>
Step 2. Stop using this account for sharing of sensitive information until you better understand the situation.
<br>
Step 3. For some platforms (e.g. Facebook, Gmail), it is possible to review conneciton history and account activity.
<br>
Check to see if your account was accessed at a time when you were not online or if your account was accessed from an unfamiliar location or IP address. 
<br>
Be mindful that if you are using the Tor browser or a VPN service, it is possible that the location or IP address may differ from the location you have accessed the platform.
<br>
Step 4. Look at the account settings. Have they changed?
<br>
For email accounts, check for auto-forwards in email, possible changes to the backup/reset email address of phone numbers, synchronisation to different devices, including phones, computers or tablets, permisions to applications or other account permisions.
<br>
Step 5. Change the passwords for all your other online accounts that are linked to this one.
<br>
For example, if you are looking at an email account and it is the recovery address for another account, change the password for that account as well.

<br>
If you no longer have access to the account, different providers have different recovery procedures or ways to rest passwords.
<br>
Some providers will send a link to change your password to your recovery email address, while other platforms reset it to your last password.
<br>
In the reset case, it is important to change the password immediately after regaining access to your account.
<br>
If these steps do not work and your account is being abused, contact the platform provider directly. Alternatively, contact the following organisations for possible support in shutting the account down.
