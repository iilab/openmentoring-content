> Step 1
# Talk to your webmaster

Contact a trusted person who can help with your website (your webmaster, the people who helped you set up your site, your internal staff if you have them and the company that hosts your site).
<br>
> Step 2
# Change your domain settings

Ask your webmaster to change the ‘Time to Live’ or TTL to 1 hour. This can help you redirect your site much faster once it comes under attack (the default is 72 hours, or three days).
<br>
# Changing settings yourself
If you are trying to do this yourself: This setting will often be found in ‘advanced’ properties for your domain, sometimes part of the SRV or Service records. Refer to the [guide put together by Gandi](https://wiki.gandi.net/en/dns/change) or work with the company you bought your domain from (like EasyDNS, Network Solutions, GoDaddy).
<br>
> Step 3
# Use a DDoS Migitation service

Have your webmaster move your site to a DDoS mitigation service. Examples:
- [Deflect.ca]
- [Google’s Project Shield]
- [CloudFlare’s Project Galileo]
<br>
If you are doing this yourself [refer to the guide Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/keeping-your-site-alive) has put together
> Step 4
# Review your needs

As soon as you have regained control, review your needs and decide between a secure hosting provider or simply continuing with your DDoS mitigation service
<br>
> DDoS mitigation services protect your website from being overloaded
