> Step 1
# Verify you website is defaced

 Verify that this is a malicious takeover of your website. An unfortunate but legal practice is to buy recently expired domain names to ‘take over’ the traffic they had for advertising purposes.
<br>
# Make payments on time
To prevent this, it is very important to keep payments for your domain name in order.
<br>
> Step 2
# Regain control of your website

If your website has been defaced, first regain control of your website login account and reset its password, see the [Account Hijacking](topics/practice-1-emergencies/2-account-hijacked/1-1-intro.md) lesson for help.
<br>
> Step 3
# Make a backup of the defaced website

Make a backup of the defaced site that can later be used for investigation of the defacement.
<br>
> Step 4
# Turn off your website

Temporarily turn off your website – use a simple landing page or ‘parked’ page.
<br>
> Step 5
# Determine how your site was hacked

Determine how your site was hacked. Your hosting provider may be able to help.
<br>
# Common reasons your site is defaced.
Common problems are older parts of your site with custom scripts/tools running on them, out of date content management systems, and custom programming with security flaws.
<br>
> Step 6
# Restore your original website

Restore your original from backups. If neither you, nor your hosting company have backups, you may have to re-build your website from scratch!
<br>
# Keep backups off your hosting provider
Also note that if your only backups are at your hosting provider, an attacker may be able to delete those when they take control of your site!
<br>
> Step 7
# Use a DDoS mitigation service

Move to a DDoS Mitigation service or secure hosting provider. Deflect.ca can support you in protecting your site from online attacks. CloudFlare can also block many common attacks.
<br>
# Detecting and preventing attacks
Secure hosting providers such as VirtualRoad/Qurium go to great lengths to detect and prevent such attacks.
