If your device is still missing take the following four steps:
<br>
Step 1: When your device has access to accounts (email, social media or web account) remove the authorization for this device for all accounts. This can be done by going to your accounts online and changing the account permissions.
<br>
Step 2: Change the passwords for all accounts that are accessible by this device. To learn more about doing this, refer to the Account Hijacked section.
<br>
Step 3: Turn on 2-factor authentication for all accounts that were accessible by this device. Please note that not all accounts support 2-factor authentication.
<br>
Step 4: If you have a tool installed on your lost devices that allows you to erase the data and the history of your device, use it.
