# Content and contacts
[What information  was on your device](topics/practice-1-emergencies/3-seized-devices/3-3-learn.md), and what might harm your [networks and  sources]((en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/3-seized-devices/3-3-learn.md) if it gets into the wrong hands? [Securely Communicate](topics/understand-4-digisec/4-secure-communications) with your networks to let them know.

# Device missing or returned
Is the device [still missing]((en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/3-seized-devices/3-5-learn.md)) or [has it been returned](topics/practice-1-emergencies/3-seized-devices/3-6-learn.md)?
