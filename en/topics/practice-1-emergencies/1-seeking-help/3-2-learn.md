How to ask for help
Start with the most secure form of communication you can manage and the person you reach out to may be able to help you establish a line of communications that is more secure, if necessary.

In many cases, it is better to reach out for help insecurely than not to reach out for help at all.

If you believe that your computer has been compromised by malware and the device you are using cannot be trusted, please go directly to the [Malware](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/4-malware/1-intro.md) section.
<br>
If you think that your communication might be targeted and/or you have just changed to a safer computer, the [Safer Emailing](link needed here!) section and [Safer Phones](en/topics/practice-3-safe-phones/0-getting-started/1-intro.md)section to establish secure communications.

Seeking and providing remote help

When you are seeking remote help from a third party please keep the following in mind:
- If you think there is something wrong with one of your devices or accounts and you are uncomfortable or unsure about what to do next, ask for help from a trained technical professional or (inter)national organizations (some listed below) whom you feel you can trust.
<br>
- Remember that the device you are using might be the subject of the attack.
- In order to establish a secure line of communication with a person who can help you, it may be necessary to contact them from an alternate, trustworthy device.
<br>
- The guides referenced in the [Next Steps](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/1-seeking-help/7-next.md) section can also help.
- If possible, do not rely on unknown people you find online.
