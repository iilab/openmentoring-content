Isaac worries his computer might be hacked into. He wants to reach out to his friend Brenda who he thinks can advise her.
<br>

But Isaac thinks that he might be at risk if he reveals too much about his situation, or worse, that he could put Brenda herself at risk if he doesn't use secure communications to reach out to her.
