title: "Where to start?"

You might want to seek help, but a good first step in any case is to assess the situation first so you can either fix the problem on your own or be more prepared when you reach out for help.
<br>
A good first step is to make sure you verify where the information is coming from. Have you received an email about an issue with your account? Did you see an error message? Has someone told you about the problem.
<br>
In all cases, you need to make sure you have verified that the information is coming from a source you trust. Make sure you recognise the email address, or the domain name. Fake emails could be sent to mislead you into giving information about your accounts.
