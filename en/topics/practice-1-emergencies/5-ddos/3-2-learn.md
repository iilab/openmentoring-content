To start, it is important to know that there are many reasons why your website can be down. Most often this is due to programming errors or technical problems at the company that hosts the site.
<br>
Sometimes, other things like legal challenges can cause a host to turn a site off as well. Before you conclude you are the victim of a DDOS attack, root out the following potential problems:
<br>
**Network problem**
To see whether your web host is working but your website is unavailable, visit https://www.isup.me/. If your site is up but you cant see it, it might be a network problem. It could also be in indication that your account has been disabled.
<br>
**Billing problem**
Make sure your billing information is up to date and that there is no outstanding balance on your hosting services or your domain name to ensure your website is not taken down for billing problems
<br>
**Legal problems**
If your website is taken down due to a legal issue, the resources provided by EFF, while focused on US copyright laws, are a good place to learn more.
<br>
**Hosting problem**
If your website is not loading at all, your hosting company may be hving problems. Visit the website of your hosting company and look for a 'status' blog, or search on Twitter.com for other users also discussing downtime with the same host.
<br>
**Censorship problem**
Can you visit other sites with similar content to your site? Try visiting websites related to yours or covering similar issues. Also try using Tor or Psiphon to access your site. If this helps, you have a blocking problem – you are still online for other parts of the world, but are being censored in your own country.
<br>
**Software problem**
Are you seeing error messages? This could be a software problem. You should reflect on any recent changes you or your team may have made and contact your webmaster. Sending your webmaster a screenshot, the link of the page you are having problems with and any error messages you see will help them figure out what might be causing the problem. You might also copy the error messages into a search to see if they are easily fixed.
<br>
**Account hijacking**
Are you seeing a website that is not yours? Are you receiving a warning from your browser about malware on your own site? This could be a defacement problem. See below for next steps; you will need to work with your web hosting provider and review the Account Hijacking section.
<br>
**Poor site performance**
Is your site loading intermittently or unusually slowly? Your site may be overwhelmed by the number and speed of requests for pages it is receiving – this is a performance problem. This could be ‘good’ insofar as your site has become more popular and it simply needs some improvements to respond to more readers – check your site analytics for a long-term pattern in growth.

If you have determined that none of these are at fault, you may be suffering from a DDOS attack. To mitigate against this, take the following four steps:
