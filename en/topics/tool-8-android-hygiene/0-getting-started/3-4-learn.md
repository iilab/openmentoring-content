# Turn off Wireless and GPS location
Switch off Wireless and GPS location (under Location Services) and mobile data (this can be found under *Settings -> Personal -> Location*). Only turn on location settings if you need them.

# Importance of turning off
Turning off Wireless and GPS location reduces the risk of location tracking, saves battery power, and reduces unwanted data streams initiated by applications running in the background or remotely by your mobile carrier.
