# Update regularly
To ensure that you phone remains secure, it is strongly recommended to keep your software updated. There are two types of updates that need to be checked:
<br>
# Operating system
The phone operating system: go to: *settings -> About phone -> updates -> check for updates*.
<br>
# Apps you have installed
Apps you have installed: Open the Play store app, from the side menu select My Apps.
<br>
**Note:** When updating your phones software it is important to do it from a trusted location such as your internet connection at home instead of somewhere like an internet cafe or coffee shop.
