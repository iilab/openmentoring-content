Your security and well being are always more important than a story. To minimise potential risks, it is important to always prepare a security assessment.
<br>
> Step 1
# Identify known hazards

Identify contact people and the time and means of communication; describe all known hazards, including the history of problems in the reporting area; and outline contingency plans that address the perceived risks.
<br>
Consider the possibility that any circumstance — from a tense political situation to a natural disaster — can escalate in severity.
<br>
The assessment should include:
- where to stay and where to seek refuge if necessary
- where and how to get updated information inside the country
<br>
- whether equipment such as a weather-band or shortwave radio is needed
- whom to contact in the country, from local human rights groups to foreign embassies, for emergency information
<br>
 - travel plans and methods within the country
 - multiple entry and exit routes.
