Your security and well being are always more important than a story. To minimise potential risks, it is important to prepare a security assessment before taking on a potentially dangerous story.
<br>
> Step 1
# Identify known hazards

Identify contact people and the time and means of communication; describe all known hazards, including the history of problems in the reporting area; and outline contingency plans that address the perceived risks.
<br>
Consider the possibility that any circumstance — from a tense political situation to a natural disaster — can escalate in severity.
<br>
The assessment should include:
- where to stay and where to seek refuge if necessary
- where and how to get updated information inside the country
<br>
- whether equipment such as a weather-band or shortwave radio is needed
- whom to contact in the country, from local human rights groups to foreign embassies, for emergency information
<br>
 - travel plans and methods within the country
 - multiple entry and exit routes.
<br>

> Step 2
# Address communications infrastructure

The assessment should address the communications infrastructure in the reporting area, identifying any contingency equipment you may need.
<br>
Are electricity, Internet access, and mobile and landline phone service available? Are they likely to remain so?
<br>
Is a generator or a car battery with a DC adaptor needed to power one’s computer? Should a satellite phone be used?
<br>
Basic needs such as nourishment and medical care must be addressed as well. Are food and water readily available? Is a hospital, clinic, or physician available? Is a medical kit needed, and what should it include?

> Step 3
# Consult diverse sources

Consult diverse sources including journalists with experience in the location or topic, diplomatic advisories, reports on press freedom and human rights, and academic research.
<br>

> Step 4
#Get input from editors

Editors working with staffers or freelancers should have substantial input into the assessment, take the initiative in raising security questions, and receive a copy of the assessment.
<br>
An independent journalist working without a relationship with a news organization must be especially rigorous in compiling a security assessment, consulting with peers,[researching the risks](en/topics/practice-2-planning/0-getting-started/1-intro.md), and arranging a contact network.
