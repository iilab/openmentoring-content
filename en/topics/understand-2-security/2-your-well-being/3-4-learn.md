##Effects
At the time of a traumatic event, the person experiencing the event might feel numb and unable to respond.
<br>
Immediately after a traumatic event, it is common for people to feel shocked, or dazed, or unable to process their own feelings.
<br>
Over several hours or days, the feelings of shock and denial gradually fade, and other thoughts and feelings take their place.
<br>
People react differently and take different amounts of time to come to terms with a traumatic event. Even so, you may be surprised by the strength of your feelings.
<br>
##Feelings you might have after a traumatic event
After an emergency or traumatic event, you may feel:
<br>
Frightened — that the same thing will happen again, or that you might lose control of your feelings and break down
<br>
Helpless - that something really bad happened and you could do nothing about it. 
<br>
Angry — about what has happened and with whoever was responsible
<br>
Guilty — that you have survived when others have suffered or died
<br>
Sad - particularly if people were injured or killed, especially someone you knew.
<br>
Ashamed or embarrassed — that you have these strong feelings you can’t control, especially if you need others to support you
<br>
Relieved - that danger is over and that the danger has gone.
<br>
Hopeful - that your life will return to normal. People can start to feel more positive about things quite soon after a trauma.
<br>
Strong feelings affect your physical health. In the weeks after a trauma, you may find that you:
-Cannot sleep
-Feel very tired
-Dream a lot and have nightmares
<br>
-Have poor concentration
-Have memory problems
-Have difficulty thinking clearly
-Suffer from headaches
<br>
-Experiences change in appetite
-Experiences changes in sex-drive or libido
-Have aches and pains
-Feel that your heart is beating faster.
<Br>
It may take weeks for some of these feelings and symptoms to pass. Remember that these are normal reactions to extreme circumstances. They are not signs that you are week or sick.

##Coping strategies for traumatic stress
Everyone has natural ways of coping. Encourage people to use their own positive coping strategies.
<br>
This will help them feel stronger and regain a sense of control. You will need to adapt the following suggestions to take account of the persons culture and what is possible in the particular crisis situation.
<br>
Encourage positive coping strategies
- Get enough rest
- Eat as regularly as possible and drink water
- Talk and spend time with family and friends.
<br>
- Discuss problems with someone you trust. 
- Do activities that help you relax (walk, sing, pray, play with children).
- Do physical exercise
- Find safe ways to help others in the crisis and get involved in community activities.
<br>
Discourage negative coping strategies:
- Don’t take drugs, smoke or drink alcohol
- Don’t sleep all day
<br>
- Don’t work all the time without any rest or relation
- Don't isolate yourself from friends and loved ones.
- Don’t neglect basic personal hygiene
- Don’t be violent
<br>
It is crucial in the weeks and months after a traumatic event to keep an eye out for changes in personal attitude (depression, frustration, etc.) as these may be signs of longer-term post-traumatic stress disorder. PTSD is addressed in the following unit.
