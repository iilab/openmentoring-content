# Trauma stress is common
Journalists and human rights defenders do difficult and challenging work, and see a good deal of human misery. We may even be fearful for our lives at times.

# How you respond
Trauma usually produces a very intense response, including fear and/or helplessness, which may overwhelm the individual’s coping mechanisms.
