# Basics
Every person has a level of challenge or threat that stimulates them to a point of maximum productivity and well-being.
<br>
# Benefits of stress
If there is not enough stimulation and challenge in our lives, we feel bored and become unproductive, even depressed.
<br>
# Too much is overwhelming
If there is too much challenge or threat, we start to become overwhelmed.
<br>
# A natural response
When we feel overwhelmed by the challenges in our work and home lives, or when we have been working too hard, for too long and without enough rest, our bodies naturally start to behave differently.
<br>
# Rest is important
Stress and fatigue can result in us identifying and responding to threats in the wrong way. If you are exhausted, burnt out or depressed, you are unlikely to be as secure or effective as you would be if you were healthier or better rested.
<br>
# Self care is empowering
Being sensitive towards ourselves and handling our emotional and physical vulnerabilities with care may contribute to our security as much as it might prove a source of inspiration and power.
