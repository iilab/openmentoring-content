title: Building trust within a team

# Increasing trust in a team
There are several ways we can work on increasing trust within a team:
<br>
# Getting to knew each other
- Getting  to  know  each  other  outside  the  professional  or  activist  context,  e.g. through out-of-work activities, socialising and having fun.
<br>
# Checking on well-being of others
- Check in regularly (e.g. before a meeting) on  your team's  stress levels, general mood, and what they are bringing to their activism from their personal lives.
<br>
# Organisational Transparency
- Transparency about hierarchies and decision-making structures.
<br>
# Clear security strategies
- Clear strategies for how to deal with personal or sensitive issues that may arise including (but not limited to) security incidents, threats and so on.
<br>
# Access to a counsellor
- Having access to a counsellor or trusted psychologist.
<br>
# Trust in managing information
Aside from trust in one another, we can also build trust in our strategies for managing sensitive information, clear channels and create means for communication about it.
