# "Be careful with each other..."
The old activist motto "Be careful with each other, so that we can be dangerous together” has a lot to do with trust.
<br>
# Productivity and security
Trusting your team is important both your organisations productivity and overall security. Building  trust  within  a  team  is  not  a  trivial  task - it  involves  investment  and  taking risks.
<br>
# Trying new tactics
Trust allows for trying new organisational security tactics, especially if you could not be, or were not involved in making decisions about it before.
<br>
# Sharing mistakes
It also creates an atmosphere of openness where you feel more comfortable sharing your security incidents, information you feel is important, and also your mistakes.
<br>
# Increased confidence
Trust gives team members confidence to know whom to talk to about which aspects of security.
