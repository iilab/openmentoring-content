# What is Enigmail
Enigmail is an interface that lets you use GnuPG encryption program from within Thunderbird. The Engimail interface is represented as Enigmail in the Thunderbird console tool bar.
<br>
# How does it work
Engimail is based on public-key cryptography. In this method, each individual must generate her/his own personal key pair.
<br>
# Private keys
The first key is known as the private key. It is protected by a password or passphrase, both to be guarded and never shared with anyone.
<br>
# Public keys
The second key is known as the public key. This key can be shared with any of your correspondents.
<br>
# Encrypting mail
Once you have a correspondent’s public key you can begin sending encrypted emails to this person. Only she will be able to decrypt and read your emails, because she is the only person who has access to the matching private key.
<br>
# Decrypting mail
Similarly, if you send a copy of your own public key to your email contacts and keep the matching private key secret, only you will be able to read encrypted messages from those contacts.
<br>
# Digital signatures
Enigmail also lets you attach digital signatures to your messages. The recipient of your message who has a genuine copy of your public key will be able to verify that the email comes from you, and that its content was not tampered with on the way.
<br>
# Verifying digital signatures
If you have a correspondent's public key, you can verify the digital signatures on her signed messages.
